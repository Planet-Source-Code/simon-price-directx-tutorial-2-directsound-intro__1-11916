## DirectX Tutorial \#2 \- DirectSound Intro


</div>

### Description

This tutorial will teach the complete newbie to DirectX/DirectSound how to Load, Play and Stop a sound (.wav) file. It is designed to be REALLY simple, there are more comments than there are lines of code (at least one comment per line of code!). Thanks to all the people who voted for my last tutorial (code of the month!), if you find this useful please do leave feedback and/or vote so I know that I should make more of this type of stuff. Look out for tutorial #3 - DirectMusic Intro!
